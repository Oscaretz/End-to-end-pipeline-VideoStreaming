# ETL Infrastructure Documentation - E-Commerce Analytics Project

## Overview

This document outlines the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) infrastructure architecture implemented for the e-commerce analytics project. The solution leverages a modern data stack with containerization, workflow orchestration, and a medallion architecture pattern to ensure data quality, scalability, and maintainability.

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. Containerization Layer
**Technology**: Docker

The entire infrastructure is containerized using Docker, providing:
- Environment consistency across development, staging, and production
- Isolated dependencies and reproducible deployments
- Simplified scaling and resource management
- Infrastructure as Code capabilities

### 2. Data Source
**Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

Raw transactional and operational data from the e-commerce platform is ingested in CSV format, serving as the entry point for the ETL pipeline.

### 3. Workflow Orchestration
**Technology**: Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow serves as the orchestration engine, managing:
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) scheduling and execution
- Task dependencies and data lineage
- Error handling and retry logic
- Monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Data Transformation Layers

The pipeline implements a **Medallion Architecture** with three distinct transformation layers:

### Bronze Layer (Raw Data Ingestion)
**Stack**: Python + SQL

**Purpose**: Initial data ingestion with minimal transformation

**Responsibilities**:
- Raw data extraction from CSV sources
- Schema validation and type casting
- Preservation of source data integrity
- Timestamping for data lineage tracking
- Basic data quality checks

**Orchestration**: Dedicated DAG Injector for Bronze layer workflow automation

### Silver Layer (Data Cleansing & Standardization)
**Stack**: Python + SQL

**Purpose**: Data quality enhancement and standardization

**Responsibilities**:
- Data cleansing and normalization
- Duplicate detection and resolution
- Null value handling and imputation
- Data type standardization
- Business rule application
- Data quality metrics computation

**Orchestration**: Dedicated DAG Injector for Silver layer workflow automation

### Gold Layer (Business-Ready Analytics)
**Stack**: Python + SQL

**Purpose**: Analytical data modeling and aggregation

**Responsibilities**:
- Dimensional modeling (facts and dimensions)
- Business metrics calculation
- Data aggregation for reporting
- Performance optimization for queries
- Semantic layer creation
- SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions) implementation

**Orchestration**: Dedicated DAG Injector for Gold layer workflow automation

## Data Consumption Layer

### Business Intelligence Platform
**Technology**: Microsoft Power BI

Power BI connects to the Gold layer to provide:
- Interactive dashboards and reports
- Self-service analytics capabilities
- Real-time data visualization
- Executive-level KPI monitoring

## Data Flow Architecture

```
CSV Source → Bronze (Raw) → Silver (Cleansed) → Gold (Analytics) → Power BI
```

1. **Extraction**: CSV files are ingested into the Bronze layer
2. **Bronze Processing**: Raw data is loaded with minimal transformation
3. **Silver Processing**: Data cleansing, standardization, and quality checks
4. **Gold Processing**: Business logic application and analytical modeling
5. **Consumption**: Power BI queries optimized Gold layer tables

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Containerization | Docker | Infrastructure deployment |
| Orchestration | Apache Airflow | Workflow management |
| Processing | Python | Data transformation logic |
| Transformation | SQL | Data manipulation queries |
| Visualization | Power BI | Business intelligence |

## Key Benefits

### Medallion Architecture Advantages
- **Incremental Quality**: Progressive data refinement across layers
- **Data Lineage**: Clear traceability from source to consumption
- **Flexibility**: Layer-specific optimization and reprocessing
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct responsibilities per layer

### Infrastructure Benefits
- **Scalability**: Containerized components enable horizontal scaling
- **Maintainability**: Modular DAGs facilitate independent maintenance
- **Reliability**: Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring through Airflow UI

## Design Patterns & Best Practices

### DAG Injector Pattern
Each transformation layer utilizes a DAG Injector pattern, enabling:
- Dynamic DAG generation based on configuration
- Consistent scheduling and dependency management
- Reduced code duplication across workflows
- Simplified maintenance and updates

### Data Quality Framework
- Schema validation at ingestion
- Quality metrics at each transformation stage
- Automated alerting for data anomalies
- Quarantine mechanisms for problematic records

### Performance Optimization
- Partitioning strategies for large datasets
- Incremental processing for efficiency
- Indexing optimization in Gold layer
- Query performance tuning for BI consumption

## Operational Considerations

- **Idempotency**: All DAGs are designed to be idempotent for safe reruns
- **Monitoring**: Airflow provides comprehensive DAG and task-level monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Automated retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Data Retention**: Layer-specific retention policies implemented
- **Security**: Role-based access control and data encryption at rest

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of data quality dashboards
- Real-time streaming ingestion capabilities
- Machine learning model integration
- Automated data profiling and cataloging
- Multi-source data ingestion expansion
