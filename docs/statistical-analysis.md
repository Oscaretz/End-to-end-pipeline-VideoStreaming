## Project: Streamlit Benchmark App (Relational vs Non-Relational Databases)

### AI Tool Information
- **AI Tool Used:** ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5)
- **Overall Assistance Level:** 69.40%

### Primary Use Cases
- **Code Generation:** 68.33%
- **Documentation:** 65.63%
- **Debugging:** 20%

### Human Contributions

#### Tasks Completed Independently:
- Defined the experimental design for benchmarking SQL vs NoSQL
- Set up the local Python environment and virtual environment on Windows
- Installed and configured required packages
- Ran and validated benchmark tests
- Structured repository and project files

#### Modifications Made to AI-Generated Content:
- Adjusted Streamlit scripts to resolve import errors
- Modified queries to align with available datasets
- Fixed runtime errors related to MongoDB local unavailability
- Customized charts and KPIs to highlight relevant performance insights
- Adapted explanations and documentation for reporting purposes

#### Original Analysis and Insights:
- Designed benchmarking logic for sales by product, top-selling product, and sales trend
- Decided to compare both **execution performance** (time, memory) and **business KPIs**
- Analyzed limitations of using SQLite in-memory vs PostgreSQL for real-world scenarios
- Proposed extensions with more complex queries (e.g., aggregations, joins)
- Drafted interpretations for KPIs in both SQL and NoSQL contexts

### Verification Process

**Code Validation:**
- Executed all AI-generated code in a controlled environment
- Validated Streamlit app functionality with different datasets
- Checked correctness of aggregation queries
- Ensured accuracy of benchmark metrics (time, memory usage)

**Documentation Review:**
- Edited AI-generated explanations for clarity and technical depth
- Ensured KPI descriptions were aligned with business objectives
- Verified that comparisons between SQL and NoSQL were balanced

**Quality Assurance:**
- Debugged and corrected errors before final integration
- Manually reviewed and tested every visualization
- Confirmed consistency between documentation and implemented app
