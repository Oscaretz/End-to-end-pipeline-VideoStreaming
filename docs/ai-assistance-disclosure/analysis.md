## Content Analysis

### Code Content
**Content Code % = (135 / 677) × 100 = 19.94%**

**Content Code Contribution = 0.35 × 19.94% = 6.98%**

### Documentation Content
**Content Doc % = (32 / 64) × 100 = 50%**

**Content Doc Contribution = 0.35 × 50% = 17.5%**

---

## Complexity Assessment
**Complexity Score = 20% (Low level - Minor fixes and small tasks)**

**Complexity Contribution = 0.25 × 20% = 5%**

---

## Self-Assessment
**Self-Assessment Score = (15 + 20 + 10 + 15) / 4 = 15%**

**Self-Assessment Contribution = 0.15 × 15% = 2.25%**

- Performed all unit testing on analytical functions
- Validated all statistical calculations against datasets
- Cross-validated results independently with alternative methods
- Verified all data transformations and aggregations

**Documentation Review:**
- Wrote majority of documentation independently
- Used AI for formatting and structure suggestions only
- Ensured all technical content was human-generated
- Added all context-specific examples and use cases independently

**Quality Assurance:**
- Conducted complete independent review of all code
- Performed all debugging and optimization independently
- Validated all statistical methods and calculations
- Generated all business insights and recommendations independently
