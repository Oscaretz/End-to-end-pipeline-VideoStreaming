### Human Contributions

#### Tasks Completed Independently:
- Connected Power BI to the SQL Server database
- Built relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Configured calculated fields and measures in Power BI
- Designed the overall dashboard layout and color scheme
- Cleaned and validated the raw data before visualization

#### Modifications Made to AI-Generated Suggestions:
- Selected the most relevant KPIs based on business context
- Adjusted recommended visual types to match stakeholder preferences
- Filtered datasets to highlight meaningful patterns
- Customized tooltips, legends, and labels for clarity
- Applied business logic to align metrics with actual requirements

#### Original Analysis and Insights:
- Defined which dimensions (SKU, Customer, Channel, Design) were most critical
- Established visual storytelling flow (from sales distribution to customer breakdown)
- Integrated historical and current product data for comparative analysis
- Prioritized metrics aligned with decision-making needs (e.g., order status monitoring, stock concentration)
- Added custom visuals to enhance interpretability

### Verification Process

**Visualization Validation:**
- Checked aggregation accuracy for all measures (sales, revenue, stock, order counts)
- Compared Power BI results against SQL queries and raw CSV data
- Confirmed filtering logic produced expected subsets
- Tested interactivity across multiple visuals (cross-filtering behavior)

**Documentation Review:**
- Verified visualization descriptions matched implemented dashboards
- Ensured instructions for database connection were accurate
- Validated relationships in model view against schema requirements

**Quality Assurance:**
- Iterated on visual design based on stakeholder feedback
- Verified performance impact of Import vs DirectQuery mode
- Ensured accessibility with clear labels, legends, and percentage formatting
